# US 008

As an Admin, I want to create a new patient profile, so that I can register their personal details and medical history.

## 1. Context

This User Story was introduced in Sprint A

## 2. Requisitos


**US 008** As an Admin, I want to create a new patient profile, so that I can register their personal details and medical history.

### 2.1. Dependências encontradas
This user story does not depend on any other.

### 2.2. Critérios de aceitação

The acceptance criteria for this user story are as follows:
* Admins can input patient details such as first name, last name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history.
* A unique patient ID (Medical Record Number) is generated upon profile creation. The format for this ID is YYYYMMnnnnnn, where YYYY and MM are the year and month of registration, and nnnnnn is a sequential number.
* The system validates that the patient’s email and phone number are unique.
* The profile is stored securely in the system, and access is governed by role-based permissions.

* The administrator must create the patient record before the patient can self-register and create their online profile.
* The administrator will be responsible for entering the patient's License Number, which is assigned by the professional guild.
* Dates should be presented to the user in the format defined by the operating system's locale settings. However, since the API is being developed in this sprint, a standard format like ISO 8601 should be used.
* It is not mandatory to create a user account when creating a patient profile. You can choose to create an inactive user account if it simplifies the implementation from a technical perspective.


## 3. Análise

*In this section, the team should report the study/analysis/comparison that was done in order to take the best design decisions for the requirement. This section should also include supporting diagrams/artifacts (such as domain model; use case diagrams, etc.),*

### 3.1. Respostas do cliente

>**Question:** So, when the administrator starts creating the patient profile, what format(s) of the date of birth will they need to enter? Furthermore, what will be the format of the Medical Record Number generated after recording the data?
>
>**Answer:** 
From a usability perspective, dates should be presented to the user using the operating system's locale definitions. since for this sprint you are building an API, you should use a standard format like ISO 8601.
>
>medical record numbers are generated by the system following the format YYYYMMnnnnnn where YYYY and MM are the year and month of the registration and nnnnnn is a sequential number

## 4. Design

*In this sections, the team should present the solution design that was adopted to solve the requirement. This should include, at least, a diagram of the realization of the functionality (e.g., sequence diagram), a class diagram (presenting the classes that support the functionality), the identification and rational behind the applied design patterns and the specification of the main tests used to validade the functionality.*

### 4.2. Testes

**Teste 1:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.*

```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
    Example instance = new Example(null, null);
}
```

## 5. Implementação

*In this section the team should present, if necessary, some evidencies that the implementation is according to the design. It should also describe and explain other important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation like, for instance, configuration files.*

*It is also a best practice to include a listing (with a brief summary) of the major commits regarding this requirement.*
