## 7.2.6 As a Doctor, I want to update the Patient's Medical Record, namely respecting Medical Conditions and Allergies.
### Acceptance criteria

- Doctors should only be able to update Medical Records for patients they are authorized to treat. This ensures data privacy and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- The system should validate the input for Medical Conditions and Allergies to prevent errors and ensure data consistency. This could involve checking for duplicate entries, validating against a pre-defined list of conditions and allergies, and ensuring the data is entered in the correct format.
- Newly updates Patient's Medical Records should be immediately reflected in the system and accessible to authorized users.
- The system ensures secure storage and retrieval of the Patient's Medical Records data.

## 7.2.8 As a Doctor, I want to create a Surgery Appointment, so that the Patient doesn’t need to wait for the automatically generated planning.
### Acceptance criteria

- Doctor Authorization: Doctors should be able to manually create surgery appointments for their patients, overriding the automated planning system when deemed necessary. This functionality empowers doctors to expedite urgent cases or address specific patient needs that might not be fully captured by the automated system.
- Schedule Validation: The system should ensure that doctor-created appointments comply with scheduling constraints, including:
  1. Staff Availability: The system should verify that all required staff, as specified by the Operation Type (e.g., surgeons, nurses, anaesthetists), are available during the chosen time slot.
  2. Room Availability: The system should confirm the selected operating room is available and appropriate for the surgery type.
- Integration with Planning Module: Doctor-created appointments should be seamlessly integrated into the planning module's schedule, updating the overall surgery plan and preventing conflicts with other appointments. This integration ensures that the manually created appointments are reflected across the system and accessible to other users.
- Override Transparency: The system should clearly indicate which appointments have been manually created by doctors, distinguishing them from automatically generated appointments. This transparency helps administrators and other staff understand deviations from the automated plan and manage potential scheduling conflicts.

## 7.2.9 As a Doctor, I want to update a Surgery Appointment, so that I can override the automatically generated planning.
### Acceptance criteria

- Doctor Authorization and Scope: The system should allow doctors to modify existing surgery appointments they have created, encompassing changes to the date, time, assigned staff, and operating room. Doctors only can update Surgery Appointments assigned to them.
- Update Validation and Constraints: The system must ensure that any updates made by the doctor maintain schedule integrity and adhere to existing constraints:
  1. Staff Availability: The system should re-validate staff availability based on the updated time slot, confirming that all necessary personnel are available and preventing double-booking of staff.
  2. Room Availability: The system should re-confirm that the updated operating room is available during the new time slot and suitable for the surgery type.
- Integration with Planning Module: Similar to creating appointments, any updates should be immediately reflected in the planning module's schedule, ensuring consistency and preventing conflicts with other appointments or resource allocations.

## 7.2.10 As an Admin, I want to add new Types of rooms, so that I can reflect on the available medical procedures in the system.
### Acceptance criteria

- Unique Room Type: The system should validate that the new Room Type is unique, preventing duplication and ensuring accurate categorization. While highlighting the system's focus on surgical appointment management, mentions different room types like "operating room, consultation room, ICU", suggesting the need for this validation.
- Type of room Attributes: Name and description are the attributes required for a new Room Type. These attributes provide essential information about the room's purpose and functionality, aiding in resource allocation and scheduling decisions.
- Relationship to Procedures: The system should allow admins to associate new Room Types with specific medical procedures or Operation Types. This linkage enables the planning module to consider room suitability when scheduling surgeries. For example, a "Cardiac Catheterization Lab" would be linked to cardiology procedures, while a "General Operating Room" might be suitable for a broader range of surgical specialties.
- Impact on Scheduling: Adding new Room Types should trigger an update to the planning module, enabling it to incorporate these new rooms into the scheduling process. This ensures the system can leverage the expanded pool of resources effectively.


## 7.2.11 As an Admin, I want to add new Specializations, so that I can update or correct information about the staff and operation type (procedure).
### Acceptance criteria 

- Unique Specialization Names: The system should validate that each new specialization name is unique.
- Data Storage: The new specialization must be securely stored within the system's database.
- Immediate Availability: The newly added specialization should be available for use in staff profiles and operation types immediately after creation.
- Consistency Across Modules: The system should ensure that the new specialization is consistent across all relevant modules, such as operation types. This consistency prevents data discrepancies and ensures accurate information representation.
